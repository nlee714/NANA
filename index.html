   <h2> Nayli </h2>
      <p> Hello! My name is Nayli. I'm currently based in Malaysia, and have been living here for the past 10 years. I grew up in Turkmenistan, and my cultural background consists of Malay, Chinese and Japanese heritage.
  I also really like consuming horror in all its forms - such as manga, movies, books and games.

  <p> <b> What is your interest in IT? </b> </p>
  
  <p> I’m interested in using technology to transform the fashion industry. 
   Online shopping has become more popular recently, however I’m looking to make an impact in the fashion industry such as creating an AI software to analyse
   and predict fashion trends as well as an interactive virtual wardrobe that will allow consumers to “try on” clothes from the comfort of their own homes. 
   Besides that, I’m also interested in the psychological effects of technology. 
   The world has become increasingly dependent on technology, with a digital surge due to the pandemic (De’, Pandey & Pal, 2020). 
   The outbreak has made corporations, teachers and students become increasingly dependent on technology, normalising concepts such as working from home and distance
   learning. Social media applications such as Tiktok and Instagram have also become increasingly popular amongst teenagers, with 32.5% of users between the age range
   of 10-19 years old (Tankovska, 2021). I’m keen to study the effects of the dependency of technology, especially its impact on mental health.
