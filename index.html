     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
   My interest in IT first started when I took a compulsory course in Computer Principles during my Foundation studies. 
   The subject taught me the basics of a computer system as well as an understanding of how the Internet and cloud computing works. 
   After completing that course, I decided to further explore my interest in IT by adding C Programming and Calculus into my course syllabus, 
   and I discovered that I enjoyed programming much more than any other subject I studied. 
   Doing well in these subjects gave me the confidence to pursue IT as a degree and career option.
   </p>
   
   <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
    Currently, I’m interested in using technology to transform the fashion industry. 
   Online shopping has become more popular recently, however I’m looking to make an impact in the fashion industry such as creating an AI software to analyse
   and predict fashion trends as well as an interactive virtual wardrobe that will allow consumers to “try on” clothes from the comfort of their own homes. 
   Besides that, I’m also interested in the psychological effects of technology. 
   The world has become increasingly dependent on technology, with a digital surge due to the pandemic (De’, Pandey & Pal, 2020). 
   The outbreak has made corporations, teachers and students become increasingly dependent on technology, normalising concepts such as working from home and distance
   learning. Social media applications such as Tiktok and Instagram have also become increasingly popular amongst teenagers, with 32.5% of users between the age range
   of 10-19 years old (Tankovska, 2021). I’m keen to study the effects of the dependency of technology, especially its impact on mental health.
  </p>
     
     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
    During the second lockdown in Malaysia, I caved in and watched a Korean drama called Start-Up.
    Although I had already chosen to pursue a degree in IT, this show definitely helped me realise how impactful the technology industry is. 
    Watching the show also introduced me to some new concepts such as machine learning, algorithms and hackathons. 
    I did not fully understand these topics at first, but I was determined to understand them and intensively read books and articles on these topics.
     </p>
     
     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
      I chose to come to RMIT because I liked the program structure for Bachelor of Information Technology and related degrees such as Computer Science and Software Engineering.
      I originally applied for Bachelor of Software Engineering program, however I was not aware of the advanced mathematics prerequisite. 
      After my first year, I might consider switching to the Bachelor of Computer Science program. 
      I expect to learn valuable programming skills as well as how to create an attractive and beginner friendly user interface.

       <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
        Being a Technology Strategy Analyst will enable me to influence the role of technology in the financial industry in Australia. I’ll be able to troubleshoot existing software and suggest methods of improvement, while also develop new technologies to improve performance. I’d also be able to approach this job from a business perspective, such as analysing consumer trends and researching investment opportunities.  
       </p>
          <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
           This job is appealing to me because I would like the chance to witness the influence of information technology in our daily lives, and a job opportunity at an Australian bank would be the best place to gain experience. In addition, I’d also like to gain knowledge and expertise outside of the Information Technology industry, which this job allows. I’d like to develop skills in business strategies, analysis as well as improve my teamwork skills
          </p>
           <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
            The job requires a degree in any field, as well as experience in various industries such as information technology, business, finance and/or start-ups. It also requires creative and social skills in order to deliver clear and concise presentations, along with converting raw data to form precise business approaches. A business or economics background would be particularly useful in navigating the tasks this job requires.
          </p>
            <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
             In order to meet these job requirements, I need to complete my bachelor degree in IT and graduate with a relevant minor, such as Economics, to boost my chances of being hired for this job. Since I’m currently struggling with Practical Database Concepts and using Structured Query Language (SQL), I intend to strengthen my skills and theoretical knowledge of databases. I should also participate in extra-curricular events during my program, such as hackathons and symposiums to explore my interests in technology, and gain an in-depth understanding of what I’m interested in. Besides that, working part-time as a software developer/programmer would also increase my chances of being employed.

     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> The results of this test has given me a better understanding of how people perceive me, and that I should embrace my strengths instead of trying to change my personality to please others. Reading about my personality type’s attributes has also helped me realise my potential and the steps I need to take to improve myself, such as empathizing with others more and being more tolerant. 
     </p>
     <h3 style="font-size:18px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Analysis </i> </h3>
     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
      Although ENTJs have difficulty working in teams, I believe that my friendly and bubbly personality will help me achieve satisfactory results, while still avoiding conflict among team members. As an ENTJ, I have a strong sense of determination and dedication when it comes to work, however, I do realise that my emotions are turbulent, which may cause me to have mood swings and lash out at my team.
     </p>
     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
      When forming a team, I should also get to know my teammates so I can empathize with their concerns and see them as equals, instead of merely focusing on the task. Learning about their traits can also help me analyse their strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to delegate tasks between us and seek help from them to strengthen my weaker abilities. I also believe tolerance and communication with others are both aspects that I can improve in.
     </p>
     <h3 style="font-size:18px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Visual Learner </i> </h3> 
     <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F"> 
      My learning style test result indicates that I am a visual learner. This allows me to visualize data and recall written information easily. I can retain information longer by making my own notes for subjects, as well as color-coding them. Additionally, my strengths also lie in observation – which can be useful for analysing trends and data.
      </p>
      
     <h3 style="font-size:18px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Enneagram Type 6 </i> </h3>

      I’ve also taken the Enneagram test to have a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. The results from the test indicate that I’m a Type Six, The Loyalist. The Enneagram Institute states that Type Sixes are trustworthy and reliable when they’re at their best. I believe these results are accurate to a certain degree as I value security and am firm in my beliefs. Additionally, I tend to obsessively analyse big decisions before I make them, as I am cautious and do not want to lose my self-confidence and sense of security. 
      </p>
       <h3 style="font-size:18px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Overview </i> </h3>
        <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
         I believe these personal attributes are valuable assets because of my dominance and leadership skills as an ENTJ can be mellowed out with my demands as a Type Six. My determination and efficiency will ensure that I make every effort to complete every project, while my cautiousness will allow me to be meticulous and minimize errors.

         Many corporations have granted their employees the option to practise remote working, however there are industry sectors who have not familiarised themselves 
         with conducting their services online. An example of this are therapists and psychiatrists.Traditionally, therapy sessions are conducted in a face-to-face setting, usually in a licensed therapist’s/counsellor’s office. However, I believe that creating an application which connects patients to available therapists virtually is worth investing in.
         </p>
        
         <h2 style="font-size:20px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Motivation </i> </h2>
         <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
          I believe it’s important to acknowledge the psychological effects the pandemic has caused. According to Malaysia’s National Fire and Rescue Department Operations, there were a total of 78 attempted suicide cases between the months of March and July 2020. Meanwhile, Befriender’s Malaysia, a local suicide prevention hotline, received around 4000 calls, during the period of the Controlled Movement Order in Malaysia (Kamel, 2020). There are many factors of the alarming increase in suicide attempts, for example, the economic impact of the pandemic has caused many businesses to shut down, leaving many unemployed and financially unstable. Besides that, the lockdown has also forced many individuals to be shut in with abusive partners or family members, potentially worsening their mental health.
        </p>
        <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
        However, even with attempted suicide cases on the rise – Malaysia did not allow mental health facilities to operate because therapy sessions required face-to-face contact. I believe that an application like this would be able to help individuals maintain stability in the comfort of their own home. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="font-size:20px;color:#BC8F8F"> <i> Description </i> </h2>
        <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
         Upon the first launch of the application, the user will be asked to fill up a Mental Health Assessment that will assess the state of their mental health. The assessment will contain questions and surveys from General Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7) and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI). Both of these questionnaires have demonstrated accuracy and reliability in diagnosing general anxiety disorder (Spitzer et al. 2006) as well as depression (García-Batista et al. 2018), and are commonly used by psychologists as a screening method for new patients. These results will be analysed by a system to determine the condition of their mental state.
Additionally, there will also be an optional form for the user to elaborate on issues they want to work on.

          After completing the assessment, the user will be directed to an interactive user interface that will enable them to choose their preferred therapist. This interface will display the profiles of available therapists/counsellor as well as a brief introduction about them. When a user taps on a therapist’s/counsellor’s profile, more details will be revealed such as their specialisation, available appointment times and credentials. This will aid them in their decision to choose a preferred therapist and sessions. Once a counsellor has been chosen, the counsellor will have access to the user’s mental health assessment results in order to have a clear understanding of the user’s needs as well as be able to construct a recovery program plan for them. Each program structure varies – users will have consultations with their counsellor to discuss preferred treatment methods before they’re enrolled. Users can choose to have a therapy session once a week or can even commit to 3-6 month long programs that involve treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy or psychotherapy.

         Once the sessions have been confirmed by the therapist, the user will be able to unlock additional features on the app, such as scheduling, private chatrooms, program plan, live chat and journaling. The scheduling feature will allow the user to view their booked sessions as well as the option to add them into their Google/Outlook calendar. Private chatrooms between the user and the therapist will only be opened as soon as the appointment begins, to maintain professional boundaries. The appointments will be conducted in these secure chatrooms – through text and/or video. While therapy sessions would be more efficient if conducted through video or physical means, I do understand that users may be anxious about these conditions; especially for the first few sessions.

        <p style="text align:center;font-family:garamond;font-size:17px;color:#2F4F4F">
         The program plan feature will enable users to be conscious of their progress to recovery. For example, if a user has been enrolled into a recovery plan that involves cognitive behavioural therapy, they’ll be able to view the duration, benefits and methods of the program. Additionally, there is a notebook feature included in this application that allows users to draw or type however they feel into a blank document. The contents of the notebook are completely private however there is an option to share them in therapy sessions. This application also includes a live-chat option that will connect users to any available counsellor on the application, in case of an emergency situation.

         Since I have minimum experience developing applications, I would test out different softwares to familiarize myself. My options include X-code and Xamarin. Xcode is an application development software that allows users to create applications on iOS platforms such as Macbooks, iPads, iPhones and Apple Watches. However, Xcode is only limited to creating applications on Apple platforms. After I’ve tinkered enough with Xcode, I’ll experiment with Xamarin and .NET, an open sourced platform to develop Android and iOS applications.

         Xcode is run using a Swift user interface, which I do not have any experience in. Learning the basics of the Swift programming language will enable me to create a user-friendly interface for my application. Additionally, I will also need to strengthen my C# programming skills to operate Xamarin and .Net, as I’ve only done C programming.
